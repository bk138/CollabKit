This package provides the neccesary tools to run a CollabKit Server (provided there
already is a MPX-enabled X Server installed).


Once installed, CollabKit can be started from the main menu.


To run from the command line, use
$ ./CollabKit start

To stop,
$ ./CollabKit stop

To run some kind of interactively as a tray icon,
$ ./CollabKit trayicon



Known pitfalls & issues:

* At least when using the intel video driver, additional mouse cursors
  are sometimes not shown when using RandR multi-head. Playing around with
  different resolutions of local and attached display is known to help.
  Clone mode works okay, though.
  
* It can happen that you have to add a multicast default route, e. g.
  when using ad-hoc networking. You can do this by issueing as root:
  
  $> route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev <output device>
  
  In case you are using Network Manager to setup adhoc networking,
  changing the connecntion's IP settings to link-local does this
  automatically for you.
  
* Current X servers (at least up to 1.9.0) only support 40 input devices.
  Taking into account that each master pointer and keyboard pair has an
  accompanying pair of XTEST devices, this leaves us with roughly 9
  connected clients + 1 local user at max. Change MAXDEVICES in
  include/misc.h in the X server sources and recompile your X server
  if you want more.
