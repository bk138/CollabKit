This package provides the neccesary tools to run a CollabKit Server (provided there
already is a MPX-enabled X Server installed).

NOTE: Change INSTALLPATH in the script if needed.

To start,run
$ ./CollabKit start

To stop,
$ ./CollabKit stop

Optionally, append -with-msg to get some visual feedback (uses zenity).

There is also a helper script in bin to setup adhoc wireless networking.
