* At least when using the intel video driver, additional mouse cursors
  are sometimes not shown when using RandR multi-head. Playing around with

* It can happen that you have to add a multicast default route, e. g.
  when using ad-hoc networking. You can do this by issueing as root:
  
  $> route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev <output device>
